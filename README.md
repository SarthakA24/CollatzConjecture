Problem Statement
---

Calculate the number of steps required to reach 1 from a given number `n` by following the Collatz sequence.

```math
f(n) = \begin{cases}3n+12&\text{ if $n$ is odd,}\\\frac{n}{2}&\text{ if $n$ is even.}\end{cases}
```

Task
---

1. Open the [source code file](src/main/java/io/github/dbc/CollatzStepsCounter.java) and complete the code.
2. Open the [test case file](src/test/java/io/github/dbc/CollatzStepsCounterTest.java) and run the test cases to
   check your code.
